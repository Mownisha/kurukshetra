          <br>
          <p>Climate change, also called global warming at times, refers to the rise in average surface temperatures on Earth.</p>
          <p>In a nutshell, it occurs when long-term weather patterns are altered.Observations throughout the world make it clear that climate change is occurring, and rigorous scientific research demonstrates that the greenhouse gases emitted by human activities are the primary driver of this mass phenomenon.</p>
          <p>The evidence is incontrovertible: Global warming is occurring. If no mitigating actions are taken, our way of life and the lives of future generations are at risk � be it through rising sea levels, more frequent natural disasters, loss of biodiversity or any of the host of consequences identified by the scientific community.</p>
          <p>Despite the international scientific community's consensus on climate change, a small number of people continue to deny that climate change exists or that humans are causing it. </p>
          <p>We think that the debate is over about whether or not climate change is real; it is now time to act to solve the problem. And Team Kurukshetra is doing just that. Through social initiatives, awareness drives, workshops, lectures, projects and much more, we are trying to do our part to fight climate change � and we ask you to join us.</p>
